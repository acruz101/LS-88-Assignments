Based on their own findings, they concluded \"average real GDP growth rate for countries carrying a public debt to GDP ratio of over 90 percent is actually 2.2%, not -0.1% as published in R&R\". We will base our own analysis after Herndon's, Ash's, and Pollin's investigation to learn where Reinhart and Rogoff went wrong. \n",
